# Terraform-demo


Every step in this tutorial is presented with a tagged commit. To switch between steps use:

`$ git checkout tags/<tag_name>` (e.g. git checkout tags/step-2)

## Step1

All the infrastructure is define in one terraform file `infrastructure.tf`.

At this stage, no storage backend is used to maintain the terraform state.
